OMG just stepped out of Borderline. Brain still buzzing, kinda wobbly like, can't even— popcorn stuck in my teeth and this weird crick in my neck from that awkward seat. But wow, the film! It’s like a kaleidoscope exploded, scenes mixing and clashing like I do with dumbbells on a bad day. That noise though, people munching loud enough to drown the whispers. Grrr. 

The part where she just stood at the edge, her thoughts spiraling like my mind does on leg day when caffeine kicks in too hard. And the colors! Vibrant like an over-enthusiastic sports brand kinda vibe. Felt like my heart echoing each stride on a treadmill. You know that moment when it feels like you’re flying but you’re not? That’s this movie.

> So remember that part, where the guy just, out of nowhere, trips into the pool? Splash! Like my failed attempts at kettleball, totally random but kinda freeing. That one line he said, man, I need to remember it — hang on... was it “something profound about boundaries and limitations”? Or did I make that up? Maybe download the movie later to catch it again. Brains are weird, wow.

Then there were those silent moments. The ones where you could hear a popcorn drop, only if someone did. So intense felt like I was holding a plank and the room's air got heavy. Moments making you think twice about life choices like picking pineapple pizza over a buff salad with quinoa. 

Catch the soundtrack? Insane beats, made my heart sync — like running to the rhythm of an arc trainer. Or am I just walking that thin line of hyperbole now? But you gotta watch the movie to get it, like actually see it. It's layered like a yogi’s motivational poster but with that indie edge – pure deadlifts for the soul.

Wow, look at me rambling... gonna stop now. Maybe.
